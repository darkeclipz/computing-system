# Computing System
This is a C# implementation of the book The Elements of Computing Systems by Noam Nisan & Shimon Schocken. Instead of grabbing a soldering iron, all the logic is done with C# implementations of logical gates to simulate it as much as possible. And for the same reason I don't want to spend hours with a soldering iron, I also don't like repetetive code. This also has been fixed as much as possible with C#. However, all the logic that is performed is done with the hardware implementations.

## Setup
Currently only the hardware is working. It can be seen by cloning the project and running the tests.
